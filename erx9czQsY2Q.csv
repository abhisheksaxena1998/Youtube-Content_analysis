3.44,0.229,3.669,So yesterday I got a comment from one you subscriber In which he said
1.891,3.669,5.5600000000000005,The reason he liked my videos more is because
2.3,5.56,7.859999999999999,I use subtitles in all of them
1.189,7.86,9.049,And this let me wondering 
7.911,9.049,16.96,It only take me a minute or two to generate subtitles 
1.0,16.96,17.96,And then hit me 
1.87,17.96,19.830000000000002,Maybe people don t know 
4.08,19.83,23.909999999999997,you can generate subtitles automatically
2.629,23.91,26.539,Hi there this is Mrinal once again And in this video we ll see
2.441,26.539,28.98,A simple way To automatically Create subtitles and closed
1.73,28.98,30.71,captions For your YouTube videos
2.71,30.71,33.42,or any video for that matter like
4.159,33.42,37.579,if you have a foreign movie clip whose subtitles are not on the internet
1.21,37.579,38.789,This method might work 
2.501,38.789,41.29,or if you someone who makes money by transcripting
4.06,41.29,45.35,videos on fiverr or rev Then this trick will make your life a lot
1.0,45.35,46.35,easier 
1.619,46.35,47.969,Now If you are interested Only in the workaround
2.36,47.969,50.329,Go to the time stamps you see on the screen
5.78,50.329,56.109,But I suggest you watch the entire video You will not definitely learn many new things
4.48,56.109,60.589,But my watch time will increase making this video rank higher haha 
1.0,60.589,61.589, 
4.201,61.589,65.78999999999999,So most guides on the internet Suggest you write down the captions manually 
3.29,65.79,69.08000000000001,Some popular blogs even suggest paying 5 on fiverr
1.89,69.08,70.97,And then There are companies like rev 
2.4,70.97,73.37,that are charging 1 for 1 minute of captions 
4.03,73.37,77.4,I mean comon We are living in the world of AI and
4.89,77.4,82.29,Still companies are charging for the product That can be done for free 
1.0,82.29,83.29, But guess what 
1.27,83.29,84.56,You don t have to do any of that 
4.08,84.56,88.64,Right now I m using the same method to automatically generate Subtitles for any
1.0,88.64,89.64,video 
1.0,89.64,90.64,And yes 
3.89,90.64,94.53,It s free You don t have to download any extra software
1.26,94.53,95.79,And works for both windows and Mac
1.18,95.79,96.97000000000001,Now this is cool 
3.59,96.97,100.56,But do you know what s awesome 
3.05,100.56,103.61,Well It also works with other languages than English
1.0,103.61,104.61,For instance
3.12,104.61,107.73,Agar me hindi me bolunga Tub bhi ye kaam karenga 
3.4,107.73,111.13000000000001,Although to be hones it s still not 100 accurate
2.43,111.13,113.56,But if you speak clearly you can easily 80 90 accuracy
3.45,113.56,117.01,And then you have to spend a minute or two to give
1.0,117.01,118.01,finally touch 
1.76,118.01,119.77000000000001, Ok mrinal so what s trick 
3.18,119.77,122.95,Well Like always Google has lot of tricks hidden in it selves
3.08,122.95,126.03,And one of those is the voice feature in Google drive 
1.0,126.03,127.03,Its default function is 
3.039,127.03,130.069,You speak And google will convert that into text
5.56,130.069,135.629,But if you try that Most of your word will lost due to background
1.401,135.629,137.03,noise And you won t get accuracy
2.209,137.03,139.239,But what if it s listening directly from the videos
4.341,139.239,143.58,I e the output of your computer becomes the input for Google voice to text
1.0,143.58,144.58,Sounds interesting 
1.9,144.58,146.48000000000002,So let s see how to do it 
2.55,146.48,149.03,MacOS This time let s start with Mac first 
4.319,149.03,153.349,Most system don t let you record your computer audio
2.31,153.349,155.659,Maybe that s because of piracy or something
3.84,155.659,159.499,So you will have to download a third party software called soundflower
2.8,159.499,162.299,The steps are simple
1.931,162.299,164.23000000000002,Open any browser And download soundflower
2.91,164.23,167.14,I ll post the link in the description
2.849,167.14,169.98899999999998,Then unzip it and install it on your computer
7.191,169.989,177.18,Next you need to tell MacOS To use the output audio as input
4.41,177.18,181.59,So go to sound settings And set soundflower 2ch on both input and
1.0,181.59,182.59,output
2.1,182.59,184.69,If are wondering what this 64 ch is for 
4.56,184.69,189.25,Well I don t know either But what I do know is it won t work with
1.819,189.25,191.069,this So stick with 2ch 
1.301,191.069,192.36999999999998,On output and input
4.78,192.37,197.15,Now fire up Google chrome and yes it only works in chrome 
1.97,197.15,199.12,Open Google docs
1.0,199.12,200.12,Create a new document
3.119,200.12,203.239,Tools Voice typing
6.26,203.239,209.499,In another tab open youTube and play any video
2.871,209.499,212.37,Now come back to Google drive Select your accent
2.199,212.37,214.56900000000002,And there start recording
2.39,214.569,216.95899999999997,And there you go 
10.851,216.959,227.81,Like I said It also works with other languages
9.83,227.81,237.64000000000001,So let s try hindi
5.829,237.64,243.469,However if you try this song It doesn t work that well
1.141,243.469,244.60999999999999,Because of background music
4.159,244.61,248.769,But if the song has no or little music Than it works well 
1.0,248.769,249.769,Windows
2.72,249.769,252.489,Now let s try this on windows
4.371,252.489,256.86,Go to your windows sound settings And select recording device
8.02,256.86,264.88,And there you should see stereo mix If you don t right click and turn on
1.15,264.88,266.03,Show disable devices
2.06,266.03,268.09,And then st Stereo mix as default 
1.45,268.09,269.53999999999996,Now let s check it 
1.3,269.54,270.84000000000003,Open Chrome And create a new document
1.22,270.84,272.06,Play a video and start recording 
2.14,272.06,274.2,Pretty cool right 
5.19,274.2,279.39,However if stereo mix is not supported by your audio driver
2.62,279.39,282.01,And these days it s hard to find this option
2.13,282.01,284.14,You can check out my other video 
4.44,284.14,288.58,Tough I ve tested this with that method So I m not sure how this is going to play 
2.04,288.58,290.62,but If you have a friend with mac
3.46,290.62,294.08,You can always Borrow it from him buy them couple of drinks 
3.67,294.08,297.75,Add caption to all your video at once 
1.639,297.75,299.389,It s worth it 
1.0,299.389,300.389, 
1.981,300.389,302.37,So this video is inspired from the comments I got yesterday
5.21,302.37,307.58,If you want me to reveal all my little known practice on youtube
1.66,307.58,309.24,Just let me know
