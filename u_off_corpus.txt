a simple way to automatically create subtitles and closed
captions for your youtube videos
if you have foreign movie clip whose subtitles are not on the internet
but my watch time will increase making this video rank higher haha 
 but guess what 
it free you don have to download any extra software
and works for both windows and mac
but do you know what awesome 
and then you have to spend minute or two to give
but if you try that most of your word will lost due to background
noise and you won get accuracy
but what if it listening directly from the videos
i the output of your computer becomes the input for google voice to text
macos this time let start with mac first 
then unzip it and install it on your computer
if are wondering what this ch is for 
well don know either but what do know is it won work with
now fire up google chrome and yes it only works in chrome 
and there start recording
like said it also works with other languages
because of background music
but if the song has no or little music than it works well 
tough ve tested this with that method so m not sure how this is going to play 
but if you have friend with mac
if you want me to reveal all my little known practice on youtube
and like always thanks for watching
